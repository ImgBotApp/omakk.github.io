This is the beginning of my little blog space on the internet. I'm not sure what to do with it or what will come of it, but I hope to engage a few people. My name is Omar Akkila and I am a recent software engineering graduate from McGill University who happens to also be on the job hunt. With the unemployment, I have the benefit (_wholly subjective_) of having some free time.

I'm currently exploring the [Rust][rust-site] programming language. The promise of performance and safety coupled with modern language features was just too enticing. I started off by reading the [Rust book][rust-book] and by playing around in the [Rust playground][rust-play].
